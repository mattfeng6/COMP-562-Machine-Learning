In this study, the EMG signals are classified based on the quality of standing using spectraldomain features obtained by three frequency transformation methods: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). The k-nearest neighbor method was used for the classification task. It is shown that CWT features have the highest classification accuracy (~ 90%) compared to STFT and FFT. This suggests that CWT provides more in-depth assessment of time-frequency content of the EMG signals that can discriminate between assisted and independent standing performances.\",\n          \"Service placement plays a crucial role in the fog computing environment, which sits between edge computing and cloud computing in the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem. The placement of services should address the challenges of energy consumption and meet the requirements for quality of service. To achieve this, it is important to consider the computational modeling of fog nodes and their placement in the network architecture. This study focuses on exploring various service placement strategies that can optimize energy consumption and improve quality of service in the fog computing environment through computational modeling. The results obtained from the study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in reducing energy consumption and improving the overall performance of the network. This research has significant implications for the design and deployment of future fog computing systems, which can benefit from the insights gained on service placement in relation to energy consumption, quality of service, and architectural considerations.\",\n          \"This paper presents the development of an affordable Energy Monitoring System that is utilized to remotely monitor the status of independent power generators, specifically solar panels for Marine IoT applications. The objective of this system is to expedite the process of remote troubleshooting, detect possible issues, and recognize the need for maintenance or recovery. The device comprises a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera, an 8-megapixel video/stills camera, a Raspberry Pi Mini-PC, two VE.Direct\\u00ae to USB interfaces, a UHF transceiver, GPS, and a power source. Its non-invasive monitoring approach involves transmitting GPS time-stamped and location-verified images of the Photovoltaic (PV) panels ashore together with infrared images through Slow Scan TV (SSTV) on a UHF carrier wave. The images are captured by the camera, modulated, and then received at an internet gateway using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver installed on a parent buoy. It is then transmitted ashore via a subsea Ethernet cable and linked to a TCP link for demodulation. Invasive monitoring is performed by connecting a USB interface to the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Solar Charge Controllers on the buoy. A Linux script run on the Mini-PC generates logs for values such as PV Voltage, Battery Voltage, Charge State, and Daily Energy Yield from the PV panels. The device aims to minimize costs and downtime, authorizing remote decisions to be made, moving towards achieving energy continuum.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\",\n          \"0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The text discusses the problem of finite-time adaptive synchronization of two-layer networks and considers the effect of stochastic perturbation. The paper proposes integrated control protocols, including a finite-time controller and an adaptive controller, to achieve synchronization of two-layer networks with identical and nonidentical topologies. The paper also presents sufficient conditions for synchronization based on the finite-time stability theory of (stochastic) differential equations. The proposed strategies can achieve a wide range of finite-time adaptive synchronization in multilayer networks. Finally, the paper uses the classical Chen system and Lorenz system as examples of node dynamics to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the theoretical results.\n",

The control law is generated by solving a finite-horizon optimal control problem at each sampling instant, aimed at obtaining a control variable that is as close as possible to a reference DSMC law, but at the same time enforces constraint satisfaction for all admissible disturbance values. Contrary to previously-proposed control approaches merging DSMC and model predictive control, our proposal guarantees the satisfaction of all standard properties of DSMC, and in particular the finite-time convergence of the state into a boundary layer of the sliding manifold.\n",

The elderly suffers the greatest number of fatal falls. Therefore, automatic fall detection for the elderly is one of the most important health-care applications as it enables timely medical intervention. The fall detection problem has extensively been studied over the last decade. However, since the hardware resources of wearable devices are limited, designing highly accurate embeddable algorithms with feasible computational cost is still an open research challenge. In this paper, a low-cost highly accurate machine learning-based fall detection algorithm is proposed. Particularly, a novel online feature extraction method that efficiently employs the time characteristics of falls is proposed. In addition, a novel design of a machine learning-based system is proposed to achieve the best accuracy/numerical complexity tradeoff. The low computational cost of the proposed algorithm not only enables to embed it in a wearable sensor but also makes the power requirements quite low and hence enhances the autonomy of the wearable device, where the need for battery recharge/replace is minimized. Experimental results on a large open dataset show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm exceeds 99.9% with a computational cost of less than 500 floating point operations per second.\",\n          \"Detection and identification of military vehicles from aerial images is of great practical interest particularly for defense sector as it aids in predicting enemys move and hence, build early precautionary measures. Although due to advancement in the domain of self-driving cars, a vast literature of published algorithms exists that use the terrestrial data to solve the problem of vehicle detection in natural scenes. Directly translating these algorithms towards detection of both military and non-military vehicles in aerial images is not straight forward owing to high variability in scale, illumination and orientation together with articulations both in shape and structure. Moreover, unlike availability of terrestrial benchmark datasets such as Baidu Research Open-Access Dataset etc., there does not exist well-annotated datasets encompassing both military and non-military vehicles in aerial images which as a consequence limit the applicability of the state-of-the-art deep learning based object detection algorithms that have shown great success in the recent years. To this end, we have prepared a dataset of low-altitude aerial images that comprises of both real data (taken from military shows videos) and toy data (downloaded from YouTube videos). The dataset has been categorized into three main types, i.e., military vehicle, non-military vehicle and other non-vehicular objects. In total, there are 15,086 (11,733 toy and 3,353 real) vehicle images exhibiting a variety of different shapes, scales and orientations. To analyze the adequacy of the prepared dataset, we employed the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to distinguish military and non-military vehicles. The experimental results show that the training of deep architectures using the customized/prepared dataset allows to recognize seven types of military and four types of non-military vehicles.\",\n          \"This paper aims to provide a design and comparative analysis of fractional order controllers for CUK converters. The study utilizes genetic algorithms for the optimization and tuning of transfer functions to achieve optimal performance in servomotors. The implementation of fractional calculus is also explored in the design of these controllers. The results of the comparative analysis highlight the advantages of using fractional order controllers over their integer order counterparts for applications in power electronics. This research contributes to the development of more efficient and robust control systems for CUK converters, with potential applications in energy systems and renewable energy technologies.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It proposes a novel iterative method based on the upper triangular relationship between nodal and branch currents, it also uses a primitive impedance matrix. The main advantage of this method lies in the possibility of avoiding inversions of non-diagonal matrices, which allows its convergence to be improved in terms of the number of iterations and processing times required in comparison to classical admittance-based methods. Three different radial dc resistive networks composed by 21, 33, and 69 nodes are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed power flow solution method. For comparison purposes, the Newton-Raphson method, and also successive approximations and Taylor-based approaches are implemented. All simulations have performed in MATLAB software.\",\n          \"This paper introduces a novel method for MRI-based subcortical segmentation using a multi-atlas guided 3D fully convolutional network. The proposed approach employs a training phase in which a set of manually segmented subcortical regions of the brain are used to train the network. Subsequently, the model is tested for its segmentation performance on new MR images using a combination of multiple atlases and three-dimensional displays. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in subcortical segmentation accuracy with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9. This study shows the potential of deep learning methods for MRI-based brain region segmentation, offering a promising avenue for improving the efficiency and accuracy of the manual annotation process.\",\n          \"Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) is a system that performed adaptive modulation scheme in which sets of modulation used by the same system adapted to the conditions of the transmission channel. This research want to make an AMC system that can distinguish Amplitude Modulation (AM), Lower Sideband (LSB), Upper Sideband (USB), Binary Phase-shift Keying (BPSK), Quartenary Phase-shift Keying (QPSK), and 8-Phase-shift Keying (8PSK) modulation automatically. AMC has an important role in the military. Modern electronic warfare, called the Electronic Warfare (EW) consists of three main components, these are Electronic Support (ES), Electronic Attack (EA) and Electronic Protect (EP). In electronic support, the main purpose is to collect the information of the received radio signal, so the AMC system can be used for this. With the AMC system, the modulation type is known to do the demodulation process, so the overlapped information can be known. The feature extraction process is one of the most important processes in AMC System. In this research, feature extraction performed is a high-order statistical feature in the time domain. The statistical order used is order 4. Information signals are passed on the transmission channel in the presence of AWGN noise interference with variable signal quality of 0 dB to 40 dB. Artificial neural network algorithm is used to classify modulation with a learning rate of 0.5 and the maximum number of epochs is 1000. By using the 4th order statistical feature, the AMC system on this research can distinguish AM, LSB, USB, BPSK, QPSK, and 8PSK modulation. This research focus on modulation that is used in HF military radio. The accuracy rate of this system in performing modulation classification without using non-linear transformations is 65.5% on 10 dB signal quality. Then, the accuracy of AMC by using non-linear transformations on the received signal reaches 88.8% on the 10 dB signal quality.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pred_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
